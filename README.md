The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystems, environment, and climate and land-use change impacts. They aim to develop new methods and tools to offer timely and relevant information about the Earth. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

## Deliverable:
Create the Earthquake Visualization

## Steps:
**1. Data set selection from:** [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
   
**2. Import and visualize the data**
   
     - Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

          - Your data markers should reflect the earthquake's magnitude by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.


    - Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

    - Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
